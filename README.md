This project integrates a Dialogflow-based chatbot into a food website, offering a conversational interface
for seamless order placement. The backend, powered by FastAPI in Python, manages interactions and
interfaces with a MySQL database for efficient order handling. Users can effortlessly place orders and
check order status through natural language conversations. This comprehensive solution aims to enhance
user experience by providing a smooth and intuitive food ordering process. The integration of a
conversational interface streamlines communication, fostering user engagement and satisfaction.
Dialogflow Configuration:

• Create a new agent in Dialogflow to serve as the foundation for the chatbot.
• Define intents for handling user queries and actions related to placing food orders, like
"OrderFood" and "CheckOrderStatus".
• Configure training phrases for each intent to teach the chatbot how to understand user inputs
accurately.
• Implement fulfillment webhook integration to connect Dialogflow with the backend server,
enabling real-time interaction with the food ordering system.
FastAPI Backend:
• Develop a backend server using FastAPI in Python to facilitate communication between the
chatbot and the food ordering system.
• Define routes and endpoints within FastAPI to handle incoming requests from the Dialogflow
chatbot and provide appropriate responses.
• Implement request validation and error handling mechanisms to ensure the reliability and
security of the backend server.
• Integrate the FastAPI backend with a MySQL database to manage order placement and
retrieval, enabling seamless interaction between the chatbot and the database.

.
MySQL Database:
• Design a MySQL database schema to store various aspects of order information including
customer details, order items, and delivery information.
• Create tables within the MySQL database to represent entities such as customers, orders,
order items, and delivery details.
• Define relationships between tables using foreign keys to ensure data integrity and
consistency.
• Implement queries and stored procedures to efficiently retrieve, update, and manage order
information stored in the MySQL database.

viii

Order Management:
• Develop backend endpoints within FastAPI to handle order placement, status updates, and
retrieval requests.
• Implement request handling logic to interact with the MySQL database, allowing for the
insertion of new orders, updates to order statuses, and retrieval of order information.
• Utilize SQL queries to interact with the MySQL database, ensuring efficient data retrieval
and manipulation.
• Implement error handling and validation mechanisms to maintain data integrity.

Integration with Food Website:

• Embed the Dialogflow chatbot into the food website's interface, providing users with a
seamless conversational experience.
• Design and implement user interfaces on the website to facilitate interactions with the
chatbot, such as input fields for order placement and status inquiries.
• Integrate backend functionality with the website to enable communication between the
chatbot and the backend server for order management tasks.
• Ensure smooth navigation and user experience by incorporating intuitive controls and visual
cues for interacting with the chatbot within the website's layout.
